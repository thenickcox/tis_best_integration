This is just a proof of concept project to look into the feasability of using Capybara without a Rack app. I pretty much wanted to be able to just point it at a URL on the web or local network and go.

1. To install just run gem install bundler if you don't already have it.
2. Now go to the project directory in your terminal and run rake or rake test
